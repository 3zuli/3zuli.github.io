My name is Adam Trizuljak. Aside from my regular SW engineering work, I like to work on various hobby projects involving Arduino, ESP8266 & ESP32, STM32, electronics design, 3D printing and more. 
<!-- I have built several mobile robots, WiFi-connected sensors,  -->

This page is a quick showcase of some of my past projects. Where possible, I'll provide links to public Git repos or other means of documentation. Let's go!
