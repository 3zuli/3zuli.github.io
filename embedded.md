## HB-100 doppler module
2016

I designed a pre-amplifier board for an HB-100 doppler radar module and made a simple Arduino sketch to measure the doppler frequency and convert it to a speed measurement, which is then shown on a display. The PCB was designed in Eagle and made with the toner transfer method.

## Arduino luxmeter
2016-17

I made a luxmeter using an BH1750 light level sensor and an Arduino Pro Mini. The original version was built on a prototype board, later I designed a proper PCB in KiCad as a project for our university PCB design class.
